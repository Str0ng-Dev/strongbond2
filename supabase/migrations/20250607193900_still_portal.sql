  # Fix RLS Infinite Recursion - Remove JWT Dependencies

  1. Problem
    - Infinite recursion between groups and group_members policies
    - JWT function doesn't exist in this setup
    - Need to simplify policies to avoid circular dependencies

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing problematic policies
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies
    - Remove org_id dependencies since JWT function is not available
    - Focus on basic user ownership and group creator permissions
